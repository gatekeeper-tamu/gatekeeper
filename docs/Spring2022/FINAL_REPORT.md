<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

Gatekeeper is a subscription management service that allows users to store login information for online services. The service is designed for individuals, roommates, families, and other groups that have a variety of online accounts with usernames and passwords. It has
a number of useful features such as encrypted storage of username and password information and scheduleable cancellation and billing reminders. Gatekeeper also functions as a group subscription sharing service by allowing users to share login information with family and friends through groups and temporary-access pages.

Gatekeeper supports authentication via Google Oauth as well as traditional username and password. Once authenticated, users can create subscription entries, view shared subscriptions, create and join groups, and set reminders. Guest users can still see temporary access pages, as well as access our public facing search service. This feature will show users which subscription services offer shows or movies you want to watch. We also provide statistics on total costs across subscriptions, groups, or our whole site. 

Gatekeeper is not limited to streaming services. Create a group today to share logins for any account!

Rebecca McFadden is the Product Owner and Scrum Master for this project. Initially, Nikhitha Vempati was the original Scrum Master, but did not fully understand or perform the duties of this role. Grace Li was the original Product Owner, but Rebecca ended up doing all of the setup work and therefore it made more sense for her to do the majority of code reviews and architecture decisions. Cora English was in charge of all UI designs and implementation.

## Architecture

<div align="center">
    <img src="mockups/design.png">
</div>
<br>

### Models:
  - User: user information, can be created through Google or regular Auth
  - Group
    - `owner` = user reference (`belongs_to`)
    - `members` = user references (`has_many`)
  - Membership: join table (`has_many_through` for Groups <- Users)
    - `belongs_to` user
    - `belongs_to` group
  - Subscription
    - `user` = user reference (`belongs_to`)
    - `groups` = group references (`has_many`)
      - NOTE: this link is called `share_records` (ex: `group_a.share_records`)
      - For more info on `has_many` and `has_many_through` see this -> [article](http://joshfrankel.me/blog/create-a-many-to-many-activerecord-association-in-ruby-on-rails/)
  - Shared_Subscription: join table (`has_many_through` for Groups <- Subscriptions)
    - `belongs_to` subscription
    - `belongs_to` group
  - Temp_Shared_Subscription: reference to a subscription with an expiration date
    - `belongs_to` subscription
  - Reminder: db model to store reminders for subscriptions
    - `belongs_to` subscription
  - Statistic, Search, Network
    - only exist for routes and helpers

For more information on gems and tools we used, visit our [dependencies report](https://github.com/gatekeeper-tamu/gatekeeper/network/dependencies) on GitHub.

We used a Google Cloud project for Oauth and an AWS project for KMS (encryption) key management. There were little to no issues setting this up. Instructions on setting this up are linked in the [getting-started](#getting-started) section. 

## GitHub

Our team had a few standards around GitHub and development processes that helped us maintain quality and efficiency. We used the [Pivotal Tracker GitHub plugin](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/github_integration/) to link branches and PRs to stories on Pivotal. We used Zapier (linked above) to copy all of our GitHub project User Stories to Pivotal. 

To standardize User Stories and Bugs, Rebecca created GitHub issue templates (can be found on the repo under [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)). All issue titles are formatted as "[Category Feature] - Description". All User Stories and Bugs have Acceptance Criteria which include key features that should be developed to complete the story as well as testing requirements. Our development process worked as follows:

1. Issue is created and assigned
2. A branch (off the current `main` branch) with a name in the format "name"/"issue description"_"pivotal #" (ex: `rmcfad/profile_icons_12345`) is created for development
3. PR is created, title matches the issue being developed, issue is linked to the PR
4. Branch is deployed to the test Heroku environment
5. PR is reviewed by the code owner
    - to be accepted, the PR must contain new tests and all current tests must pass
6. Devlopment branch is synced with `main`
    - `pull --rebase origin main`
    - fix conflicts
    - `push --force-with-lease origin HEAD`
    - see [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-rebase-and-update-a-pull-request) for more info
6. Branch is merged with closing tags for Pivotal Tracker (see [article](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/github_integration/))
7. Pivotal Tracker story is Accepted/Rejected and closed

The main branch was locked to only allow commits via PRs after Iteration 1. All PRs also required at least 1 approving review to be merged. The repo was also configured to only allow PRs to be [squashed and merged](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#:~:text=When%20you%20select%20the%20Squash,merged%20into%20the%20default%20branch.) so that the only commits on the `main` branch were singular commits per PR. 

Each Iteration had an associated [Release](https://github.com/gatekeeper-tamu/gatekeeper/releases) of the code. We created Releases using the GitHub Release feature. A release was published using a new tag (ex: v2.0, v3.0) on the GitHub web app. 

There were some development spikes mostly due to the fact that there were a few iterations where only one (or sometimes two) team members did any significant work. 

## Testing

All of our user stories were written in terms of the behaviors expected at the completion of the user story. We had both Cucumber and Rspec tests. Rspec tests were written before the code about 50% of the time. We then made sure the key functionality of each user story (issue) was tested in unit and functional tests before a PR was merged. In the case of a bug fix, we made sure that the scenario that caused the bug in the first place was tested to verify that future developement would not cause the same issue. 

Since we only did Test Driven Development (TDD) around 50% of the time, we occasionally had tests that were more tailored to the happy path instead of a comprehensive examination of code functionality. However, since the acceptance criteria of each user story/bug included testing requirements, we ended up with a large suite of tests and decent metrics for the quality of our appliation. By making sure each new feature was tested properly, we were actually able to catch some bugs caused by new development before PRs were merged.

## Deployment

We had two Heroku deployment environments: one for testing and one production environment. Before each PR was merged, we deployed the branch to the test Heroku environment to verify that the code functioned outside of a local development environment. 

Both environments were set up with GitHub access. This allowed us to see the status of a GitHub deployment on the PR UI and the main GitHub page. (NOTE: As of 4/19/2022, this service was disabled because of Heroku security breach) This access also allowed us to have our `main` branch auto-deploy to the production environment.
